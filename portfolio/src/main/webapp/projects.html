                    <h4>ShiftLog</h4>
                    <p>This was a piece of software I wrote to automate making shift logs. These shift 
                        logs were specific to my employer at the time. This was a personal program, and 
                        not for use by the company. It was made solely for the purpose of making my life 
                        easier. It produced a locally saved .xlsx file that I later email to the supervisor.
                        The program was written in C++, and used the OpenXLSX library. The code has long since
                        been lost, but I intend to re-code it someday for the nostalgia.

                    <h4>Unnamed</h4>
                    <p>As an introduction to Java, I attempted to create a simple 2D game that involved many moving
                        objects, and collision processing. I tried to make it as well rounded as possible, including 
                        features like multiple levels, health/money tracking, interations, save files, etc.
                        The original code is currently on a run down laptop, and I have only a draft repo
                        up on github right now, under "shootEm".

                    <h4>Various Class Projects</h4>
                    <p>I have had several class projects that became more than just a few lines of code.
                        Some of these are:

                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li> AlgoRuntimeTester (Tested the run-time of various algorithms)</li>
                        <li> Booth's Multiplication Algorithm Simulator (Simulated how this Algorithm runs through physical hardware)</li>
                        <li> Cache/Mem Simulator (Simulated how internal CPU cache, and Memory work to access/load data)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Bill Manager for Roomates</h4>
                    <h6>Planned</h6>
                    <p>I am planning to write a program that you will be able to access all accounts within 
                        a household, and show any balances due. Along with the ability to "split-up" each
                        bill evenly between roomates, and track who has paid in, or is able to pay in.
                        I plan to use a Java server with Spring Boot to help run the backend, as well 
                        as incorporate OAuth2.0 capabilites to allow automated capture of account statuses
                        from various vendors. The front end is still to be determined.
