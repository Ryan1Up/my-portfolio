                I am currently carrying out a 6 year sentence, 4 years with good grades, to get my 
                Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I failed out in the fall of 2014, but I did
                not let that stop me from getting my grades back up to be re-admitted and try again.

                I started attending classes here as a freshman in highschool. This allowed me to attain
                several college credits, mostly in the general ed courses. I went through several majors 
                here before eventually deciding on Computer Science.
