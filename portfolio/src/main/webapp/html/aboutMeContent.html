<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="sm text-left"> I am an aspiring Software and Machine Learning Engineer,
    taking courses at California State University of Fresno. I am a CSCI major, in my second year
    of CSCI courses. My goal is to use machine learning and other techniques to help develop
    greener technologies, and possibly find or improve renewable fuel sources.

    I am currently living in Fresno with a roomate who also goes to Fresno State, and my two dogs. 
    Most of my experience as a programmer has been mostly writing small utility programs to make
    day to day tasks easier for myself. I am currently studying web based programming due 
    to being a part of this Google SPS program, and so far I am really enjoying it. Its 
    expanding my skillset in really useful ways that I had not previously thought of.

    Most of my hobbies through the years revovled around group activities, like paint-ball, 
    or table top games. Though, due to Covid, I found a new hobby that helps me learn more 
    about coding in general. That is, fixing/modding games written with the Ruby Game Scripting System.
    I have mostly learned with C++ and Java, and this hobby helps me expand into Ruby as well.
